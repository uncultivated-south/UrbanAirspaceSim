# UrbanAirspaceSim: A Simulation Framework for Congested Low-Altitude Airspace

## Vision
 
The rapid deployment of **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**, **eVTOLs**, and other aerial mobility technologies will put significant pressure on cities' limited sky corridors.
In the near future, **urban low-altitude airspace will become increasingly congested**. 

Airspace, once considered an open and limitless environment, will transform into a **scarce and valuable resource**.  
Effective management of this resource is essential to ensure safety, fairness, and the sustainable growth of urban air mobility.

## Why an Economic Perspective?

As congestion grows, relying solely on technical pathfinding methods is insufficient.  
By treating **airspace as an economic resource**, we can:

- **Internalize scarcity**: Assign value to congested airspace segments.  
- **Enable multi-party interaction**: Encourage cooperation and negotiation between operators, regulators, and service providers.  
- **Optimize allocation**: Use market-inspired mechanisms such as auctions to achieve efficient global distribution of airspace slots.  

This project explores how **auction-based methods** can be combined with **conflict-based search (CBS)** in multi-agent pathfinding, creating a framework where **algorithmic optimization meets economic reasoning**.
